                                            non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web 
                                            browsers and servers typically make available, such as the 
                                            browser type, language preference, referring site, and the 
                                            date and time of each visitor request. Donaide’s purpose in 
                                            collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
